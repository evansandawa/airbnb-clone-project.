# airbnb-clone-project.
The Airbnb Clone project aims to recreate core features of the Airbnb platformâ€”specifically listing properties, booking stays, and managing user accounts. The goal is to practice building a scalable, database-driven web application while applying principles of object-oriented programming, RESTful API design, and responsive front-end development.
